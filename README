A script that automatically maps buffers to function keys.

Keys:
F<n>
        Switch to window 1 through 12.
SHIFT-F<n>
        Switch to window 13 through 24.
ALT-1 through ALT-0
        Switch to window 1 through 10.
CTRL-W, F<n>
        Swap the buffer in the current window with the one
        in window n, and activate window n.
CTRL-W, SHIFT-F<n>
        Swap the buffer in the current window with the one
        in buffer n+12, and activate window n+12.
CTRL-W, ALT-<n>
        Swap the buffer in the current window with the one
        in window n, and activate window n.
CTRL-W, c
        Close the current buffer. This does ":bdelete",
        so it will not work when there are unsaved changes.
        Use ":bd!" in this case if you want to discard them.
CTRL-W, .
        Move buffers along to lower numbered windows
        (useful after closing a buffer)
CTRL-W, /
        List all Windows.
